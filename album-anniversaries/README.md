# Audioxide calendar

Written in Python, the program combs through a CSV file of albums reviewed on _Audioxide_ and highlights any nearing an anniversary. This is currently done in five-year increments. For example, if two albums are turning 10 and another is turning 25 in the month the program is run, they will all be returned by Martin the Deficient Virtual Assistant.
